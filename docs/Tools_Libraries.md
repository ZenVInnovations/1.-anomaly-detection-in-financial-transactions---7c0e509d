# üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries Used

This project utilizes a robust stack of Python libraries and development tools to detect anomalies in financial transactions efficiently.

---

## üêç Programming Language

### Python
- The core language used for scripting, data preprocessing, model training, and app development.

---

## üìö Python Libraries

### 1. **Pandas**
- For data manipulation and analysis.
- Efficient in handling large CSV files.

### 2. **scikit-learn**
- Provides machine learning algorithms and preprocessing utilities.
  
-Used here for:

-Training the Isolation Forest model.
-Scaling data with StandardScaler.

### 3. **Joblib**

- Used to save and load machine learning models efficiently (.pkl format).
- Makes deployment of the trained model easy.

### 4. **Streamlit**

- A Python library to build web apps for data science.
- Powers the front end of this anomaly detection tool, allowing:
- CSV file uploads.
- Real-time anomaly flagging.
- Visualization of results.

### 5. **Matplotlib**

- Used for creating static visualizations of transaction data and anomalies.
- Helps illustrate model output visually.

### 6. **Seaborn**

- Built on top of matplotlib.
- Provides advanced visualization capabilities for exploring data distribution and anomalies.
